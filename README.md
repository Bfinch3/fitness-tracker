## Objective
As a final project our team wanted to create a full stack MERN application to demonstrate the skills we have learned these past 3 months. We present our Fitness Tracker Application.

## Description

Looking for a way to track your favorite workouts! Checkout our Fitness Tracker Application. Our fitness app allows the user to login and create their own personal workout profile. Within their profile, the user can select the type of workout they are doing or just did and write a description about it. They can also make comments about the workout they just finished and if they recommend it. The user can also be part of a workout community by adding other users who are currently using the fitness app.
